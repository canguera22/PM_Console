Limited Access Death Master File Monthly Updates
Please note: This site contains six months of downloads. If you do not download within the six month
timeframe and require an older version of the data, you will be required to purchase the file on a CD.
The following updates are available for the current quarter. Update data is not cumulative. Therefore,
it may be necessary to download more than one file, and apply them in chronological order. Failure to
apply all files in the proper order will result in a corrupt or incorrect master list. Also note that both
the ASCII and EBCDIC versions are available; however, it is only necessary to download the version
corresponding to your master file.
For your convenience, MD5 checksums for each file are listed below. These may be used to verify that
you have successfully completed your download. In order to verify these checksums, you will need to
obtain an MD5 sum generator. For your convenience, one is available through the Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQs) page. If the MD5 sum generated by the program does not match the one for the
corresponding file below, please retry your download.
Notice from Social Security Administration regarding Death Master File Update Schedule:
